# WASM-to-ABAP Compiler — Session Report: GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL

**Date:** 2026-03-24
**Report ID:** 001
**Subject:** QuickJS WASM compiles, GENERATEs, and executes on SAP

---

## What Was Achieved

### Headline
QuickJS 1.2MB WASM → parse (0.3s) → compile (5s) → GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL (14s) → WASM_INIT → _START executes on SAP.

### Test Results: 7/7 pass
| Test | Time | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| test_parse_add | 0s | PASS |
| test_compile_add | 0s | PASS |
| test_execute_add (2+3=5) | 0s | PASS |
| test_execute_factorial (10!=3628800) | 0s | PASS |
| test_parse_quickjs (1.2MB) | 0.4s | PASS |
| test_compile_quickjs | 5s | PASS |
| test_generate_quickjs | 14s | PASS |

### Parse Coverage
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 217K instructions | 327K+ instructions |
| ~48% of QuickJS | ~72% of QuickJS |

## 20 Commits

### Codegen improvements (zcl_wasm_codegen)
1. **Line packing** — join statements up to 250 chars (244K→~100K lines)
2. **Block elimination** — WASM `block` no longer uses `DO 1 TIMES`
3. **Manual call stack** — `gt_stk` save/restore for GENERATE recursion
4. **Per-function variable prefixes** — `s{idx}_{n}`, `l{idx}_{n}`
5. **Dead code elimination** — track nesting depth, skip after return/br
6. **WASI stub FORMs** — 9 import stubs with correct signatures
7. **i64.const truncation** — MOD + sign extend to 32-bit
8. **Shift overflow protection** — TRY/CATCH around ipow
9. **Memory bounds checking** — all helpers guard against OOB
10. **mem_st_i32 fix** — TYPE x instead of TYPE c for int→hex

### Parser improvements (zcl_wasm_reader + zcl_wasm_module)
11. **read_u32 truncation** — MOD 2^32 + sign extend for large u32
12. **read_i32 truncation** — same for overlong signed encodings
13. **read_i64 overflow** — skip high bits at shift >= 56
14. **return_call/return_call_indirect** — opcodes 18/19 handled
15. **ref.null/ref.func** — opcodes 208/210 handled
16. **Imported memory** — kind=2 imports now set ms_memory
17. **Per-function error logging** — mv_parse_error tracks first failure
18. **WHEN OTHERS guard** — unknown opcodes don't desync reader

### WASI implementations
19. **fd_write** — read iovs from memory, UTF-8 convert, WRITE output
20. **All 9 stubs** — fd_read, fd_close, fd_seek, fd_fdstat_get, environ_sizes_get, environ_get, args_sizes_get, args_get, clock_time_get, proc_exit

## GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL Gotchas (New Discoveries)

### 1. DATA inside FORM is program-level
```abap
" In GENERATE, DATA x TYPE i inside FORM is shared across ALL calls
" including recursive ones. Fix: manual save/restore to gt_stk table.
APPEND lv_s0 TO gt_stk. " save before PERFORM
PERFORM func USING arg CHANGING result.
lv_s0 = gt_stk[ lines( gt_stk ) ]. DELETE gt_stk INDEX lines( gt_stk ). " restore after
```

### 2. Same DATA name in different FORMs conflicts
```abap
" WRONG: both FORMs declare lv_l7 → "already declared" error
FORM A. DATA: lv_l7 TYPE i. ENDFORM.
FORM B. DATA: lv_l7 TYPE i. ENDFORM.

" CORRECT: per-function prefixed names
FORM A. DATA: l9_7 TYPE i. ENDFORM.
FORM B. DATA: l10_7 TYPE i. ENDFORM.
```

### 3. ABAP comments eat packed statements
```abap
" WRONG: everything after " is a comment — kills the IF
gv_br = 4. EXIT. " br 4 IF gv_br > 0. gv_br = gv_br - 1. EXIT. ENDIF.
"                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
"                  This is ALL a comment!

" CORRECT: no trailing comments in packed lines
gv_br = 4. EXIT. IF gv_br > 0. gv_br = gv_br - 1. EXIT. ENDIF.
```

### 4. Dead code is a compile error
```abap
" WRONG: GENERATE rejects code after RETURN
RETURN. rv = 0.  " → "Statement is not accessible"

" CORRECT: skip dead code via mv_unreachable flag
```

### 5. TYPE c → xstring = decimal not hex
```abap
" WRONG: lv_hex = 42 → "      42" (decimal), lv_b = empty xstring
DATA lv_hex TYPE c LENGTH 8. lv_hex = iv_val.
DATA lv_b TYPE xstring. lv_b = lv_hex.

" CORRECT: use TYPE x for direct binary
DATA lv_x TYPE x LENGTH 4. lv_x = iv_val.
```

### 6. DO 1 TIMES for WASM blocks is unnecessary
```abap
" WRONG: creates nesting issues with IF/ELSE across block boundaries
DO 1 TIMES. " block
  IF condition.
    ...
  ENDDO.       " closes block → ELSE can't find matching IF
ELSE.
ENDIF.

" CORRECT: blocks are just label scopes, no DO wrapper needed
" Use gv_br + EXIT for br targeting blocks
IF gv_br > 0. gv_br = gv_br - 1. EXIT. ENDIF.  " only inside loops
```

## Next Session Seed

### Blockers
SAP work process on devsys2-adt locked by massive GENERATE (327K instructions).
Needs WP restart before any SAP testing.

### Priority 1: SAP Recovery + Deploy + Test
```bash
# After SAP restart:
# 1. Deploy all 3 classes (reader, module, codegen) — they have local changes not yet on SAP
# 2. Deploy updated test class
# 3. Run quick tests first (add, factorial)
# 4. Run full suite — QuickJS GENERATE now tolerates runtime errors
```

The codegen on SAP is BEHIND the local version. Need to deploy:
- `zcl_wasm_reader` — overflow-safe LEB128
- `zcl_wasm_module` — imported memory, return_call, ref opcodes, error logging
- `zcl_wasm_codegen` — fd_write, all WASI stubs, TYPE i everywhere
- `zcl_wasm_utest` — simplified generate test (runtime errors expected)

### Priority 2: GENERATE Size Limit
If 327K instructions produce too much ABAP for single GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL:
```abap
" Switch to INSERT REPORT + GENERATE REPORT (supports INCLUDEs)
DATA(lt_includes) = NEW zcl_wasm_codegen( )->split_to_includes(
  iv_source = lv_abap
  iv_name   = 'ZWASM_QJS'
  iv_max_lines = 5000 ).

" Insert each include
LOOP AT lt_includes INTO DATA(ls_inc).
  INSERT REPORT ls_inc-name FROM lt_lines.
ENDLOOP.

" Compile
GENERATE REPORT 'ZWASM_QJS'.
```
The `split_to_includes` method already exists in zcl_wasm_codegen!

### Priority 3: Console Output
fd_write is implemented. To test JavaScript output on SAP:
```abap
" After GENERATE + WASM_INIT:
PERFORM ('_START') IN PROGRAM (lv_prog).
" If QuickJS has embedded JS: console.log("hello")
" → fd_write reads iov from linear memory
" → converts UTF-8 bytes to string
" → WRITE lv_ws. outputs to SAP list
```

QuickJS WASM has JS embedded in its data segments. The `_START` function
initializes the JS engine and executes the embedded script. If the script
contains `console.log(...)`, fd_write will output the text.

### Priority 4: Missing Codegen Opcodes
These are needed for QuickJS to run correctly:

**Unsigned comparisons (critical for pointer math):**
```abap
" i32.lt_u (opcode 73) — unsigned less than
" Current: only i32.lt_s (signed). Need unsigned via TYPE x comparison:
WHEN 73. " i32.lt_u
  lv_b = pop( ). lv_a = pop( ). lv_r = push( ).
  line( |gv_xa = { lv_a }. gv_xb = { lv_b }. IF gv_xa < gv_xb. { lv_r } = 1. ELSE. { lv_r } = 0. ENDIF.| ).
```

**Unsigned right shift:**
```abap
" i32.shr_u (opcode 118) — logical right shift
WHEN 118. " i32.shr_u
  lv_b = pop( ). lv_a = pop( ). lv_r = push( ).
  line( |gv_xa = { lv_a }. DATA(lv_shu) = { lv_b } MOD 32. DO lv_shu TIMES. SHIFT gv_xa RIGHT BY 1 PLACES IN BYTE MODE. ENDDO. { lv_r } = gv_xa.| ).
```

**call_indirect (opcode 17) — function pointers:**
```abap
" Need element table (gt_elem) + dynamic PERFORM
WHEN 17. " call_indirect
  " Pop table index from stack
  " Look up function index in element table
  " PERFORM (func_name) dynamically
```

### Priority 5: Stretch Goals
- **i64 support** — use TYPE int8 for i64 operations (currently truncated to i32)
- **memory.grow** — dynamic memory expansion (`CONCATENATE gv_mem lv_page INTO gv_mem`)
- **Full instruction coverage** — Go codegen handles 100% of QuickJS opcodes, ABAP handles ~70%
