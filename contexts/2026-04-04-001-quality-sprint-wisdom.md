# Quality Sprint Session Wisdom

**Date:** 2026-04-04
**Session:** Quality & Stability Sprint — PR triage, bug fixes, community intake
**Duration:** ~3 hours active work

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Session Default: Stateless wins
- `SessionStateful` was the root cause of "Session not found" errors on POST operations
- SAP ICF binds `sap-contextid` to the first endpoint hit (`/core/discovery`), subsequent requests to `/datapreview/freestyle` fail
- Fix: change default in `config.go:186`, NOT via append in `server.go` (PR #79's approach overrides user's explicit stateful choice for debugger)
- Stateless is correct for 95% of use cases; debugger explicitly sets stateful

### Installer: Never abort on package creation failure
- `/sap/bc/adt/packages` doesn't exist on SAP_BASIS 7.40
- Users can pre-create packages via SE21/SE80
- `WriteSource` will fail with clear error if package truly doesn't exist — better UX than aborting early

### ADT Version Differences Are Real
- Birzhan: `vsp query` works on new system, fails on old
- Alexander: "I don't have GetTable and GetStructure" *(translated)*
- `/sap/bc/adt` is ONE node in SICF — if search works, the service is active
- Individual endpoints like `datapreview/freestyle` may not exist on older releases
- Need: `vsp probe` capability discovery command

### PR Triage Rules (for this project)
- **Docs PRs:** merge immediately, almost zero risk
- **New tool PRs:** verify ADT endpoints are real (not fabricated). Check against ADT discovery docs
- **Large PRs (8K+ LOC):** never merge as-is. Cherry-pick verified parts, credit author
- **Safety bugs in tests:** ReadOnly blocks WRITES (CDUAW), not READS. Common mistake in community PRs
- **Duplicate CSRF helpers in tests:** each test file copies `newCSRFResponse()` — annoying but harmless pattern

### Cobra PersistentFlags Gotcha
- `rootCmd.Flags()` = local flags, invisible to subcommands
- `rootCmd.PersistentFlags()` = inherited by all subcommands
- Also need `PersistentPreRunE` to read env vars (viper) for CLI subcommands — `resolveConfig()` only runs in MCP server mode

### fmt.Errorf Go Vet
- Go vet now rejects `fmt.Errorf(variable)` — must use `fmt.Errorf("%s", variable)`
- This broke pkg/dsl in recent Go versions

## PR Review Findings (preserve for future)

### blicksten PRs (#82-#86) — Quality Assessment
- **#83 (version history):** HIGH quality. Real Atom feed endpoints. Clean code. MERGED.
- **#85 (CDS tools):** Good. Real endpoints. Safety bug in tests (ReadOnly vs OpRead). CHERRY-PICKED with fix.
- **#84 (testing):** Mixed. CodeCoverage + CheckRun good. SQLExplainPlan dubious — DROPPED. CHERRY-PICKED 2/3.
- **#82 (refactoring):** Endpoints likely NOT exposed in ADT. Need SAP verification. DEFERRED.
- **#86 (intelligence):** Does NOT compile (missing functions). Duplicates pkg/abaplint. 4K LOC but LLM does this natively. DEFERRED/REWRITE.

### Other Notable PRs
- **#38 (mcp-go upgrade):** Strategic but massive (37 files). Do as separate track.
- **#77 (Browser SSO):** Good impl but mixes SSO + keepalive. Split into 2.
- **#53 (Clean Core):** Bug: `url.PathEscape` on ADT URI breaks slashes. Reimplement.
- **#41/#42 (gCTS/i18n):** Solid but no tests. Add tests before merge.

## Test Coverage Analysis

**Overall: 32.5%** — critical gaps in CRUD/safety/handlers

| Priority | Area | Coverage | Action |
|----------|------|----------|--------|
| P0 | Transport safety checks | 0% | Add mock tests |
| P0 | CRUD operations (Lock/Update/Delete) | 0% | Add mock HTTP tests |
| P1 | MCP handlers | 8% | Test routing + validation |
| P1 | Code intelligence | 0% | Test XML parsing |
| P2 | Config loading | 24% | Test with temp files |
| P2 | WebSocket/debugger | 0% | At least test parsers |

**Opportunity:** Use Lua scripting (`pkg/scripting`) and DSL workflows (`pkg/dsl`) for integration test automation against real SAP.

| Issues closed | 2 (#30, #34) |
| Issues fixed in code | 4 (#81, #87, #75, #76) |
| New tools added | 7 (pagination + CDS + version + testing) |
| Tests fixed | 2 packages (dsl, jseval) |
| Release published | v2.33.1 |

## What Worked Well
- Parallel agent reviews (3 agents reviewing PRs simultaneously) — saved ~30min
- Cherry-pick approach for conflicting PRs — cleaner than force-merging
- Testing on real SAP after each change — caught issues early
- Closing PRs with specific commit references and credit — good community relations

## What Could Be Better
- Should have run `go test ./...` at the START to establish baseline (found pre-existing failures)
- PR #86 should get a "do not merge" label to prevent accidental merge
- Need automated CI (GitHub Actions) to catch build failures from PRs
