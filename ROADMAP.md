# Roadmap: vsp Development Plan

> Last Updated: 2026-08-16

> **Current planning lives in [reports/2026-07-11-001-improvement-plan-and-landscape.md](reports/2026-07-11-001-improvement-plan-and-landscape.md) and [reports/2026-08-15-001-sap-mcp-skills-landscape-and-roadmap.md](reports/2026-08-15-001-sap-mcp-skills-landscape-and-roadmap.md).** The phase list below is kept as historical structure; do not treat its unchecked items or dates as commitments.

## Current Status

See the **Project Status** table in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — version, tool modes/counts, test counts, and platforms are maintained there (code-derived, re-measured on update) rather than duplicated here.

### Phase 5: TAS-Style Debugging (v2.14-2.15) ⚠️ Partial (see 5.2–5.4)

**Goal:** Scriptable, replayable debugging — record, checkpoint, and replay execution deterministically.

#### 5.1 Lua Scripting Integration
- [x] Integrate gopher-lua into vsp
- [x] Expose all MCP tools to Lua
- [x] Create Lua REPL for interactive debugging
- [x] Document scripting API (examples + reports)

```lua
-- Target API
while true do
    local event = waitForBreakpoint(30)
    if not event then break end
    saveState("checkpoint_" .. event.hit_count)
    stepOver()
end
```

**Effort:** 2 weeks
**Files:** `pkg/scripting/lua.go`, `internal/mcp/lua_bindings.go`

#### 5.2 Variable History Recording ⚠️ Partial

> Data model and storage shipped; live capture from a debug session is not yet wired in — see [reports/2026-07-11-002-vision-achievability-review.md](reports/2026-07-11-002-vision-achievability-review.md) §3.1.

- [x] Design execution frame structure
- [ ] Implement frame capture at each debug step (data model shipped, live capture unwired)
- [x] Delta compression for storage efficiency
- [x] "Show state at step N" command

```go
type ExecutionFrame struct {
    StepNumber int
    Location   CodeLocation
    Variables  map[string]Variable
    DBOps      []DBOperation
    RFCCalls   []RFCCall
}
```

**Effort:** 2 weeks
**Files:** `pkg/adt/recorder.go`, `pkg/adt/history.go`

#### 5.3 Checkpoint System ⚠️ Partial

> Serialization and storage shipped; capture/restore against a live session depends on the unwired capture path above — see [reports/2026-07-11-002-vision-achievability-review.md](reports/2026-07-11-002-vision-achievability-review.md) §3.1.

- [x] Serialize variable state to JSON
- [x] Store checkpoints locally (in-memory + file)
- [ ] Restore checkpoint (variable inspection) — pending live-session wiring
- [x] Checkpoint management commands (save/get/list)

#### 5.4 Watchpoint Scripting ⚠️ Partial
- [ ] Scriptable watchpoint conditions — partial
- [x] All breakpoint types: line, statement, exception, message, BAdi, enhancement, watchpoint, method
- [x] 8 breakpoint type functions in Lua

#### 5.5 Force Replay (State Injection)
- [x] SetVariable API (modify variables in live session)
- [x] InjectCheckpoint (restore all variables from checkpoint)
- [x] ForceReplay (inject state from recording at specific step)
- [x] ReplayFromStep (inject state from current recording)

```lua
-- The killer feature: Inject production state into dev session
forceReplay("production_dump_001")  -- Inject and debug!
```

#### 5.6 Testing & Documentation
- [x] 59 unit tests (recorder, history, Lua bindings)
- [x] E2E test script (`examples/scripts/phase5-experiment.lua`)
- [x] Testing methodology report
- [x] Data extraction examples report
- [x] Live experiment documentation

- [ ] Extract inputs from entry frame
- [ ] Extract outputs from exit frame

- [ ] Jump to step

**Effort:** 2 weeks

- [ ] Explore alternate path
- [ ] Compare outcomes

**Effort:** 3 weeks

## Future: Phase 9+

### WebSocket Enhancements (Ongoing)

**ZADT_VSP APC Handler** provides stateful WebSocket capabilities not available via REST:

#### Completed Domains
- **RFC Domain**: Call any function module via WebSocket
- **Debug Domain**: Stateful ABAP debugging with session persistence
- **AMDP Domain**: HANA/SQLScript debugging (interface issue pending)
- **Submit Domain**: Execute any ABAP program (SUBMIT)

#### Planned Domains
- [ ] **abapGit Domain**: Package export/import via chunked transfer
