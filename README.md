## Hot Right Now

### Package Analysis Suite

Five analysis commands that answer real questions about your ABAP packages:

```bash
vsp health --package '$ZDEV'                    # tests + ATC + boundaries + staleness
vsp health --package '$ZDEV' --report html      # full HTML report with details
vsp slim '$ZDEV' --level methods                # dead code detection (method-level)
vsp api-surface '$ZDEV' --include-subpackages   # Clean Core: which standard APIs do you use?
vsp boundaries '$ZDEV'                          # directional boundary crossing analysis
vsp boundaries '$ZDEV' --format mermaid         # visual graph with package subgraphs
```

### Transport & Change History

```bash
vsp changelog '$ZDEV' --since 20260101          # what changed in this package?
vsp changes '$ZDEV' --attribute SAPTEST         # group transports by CR attribute (E070A)
```

### Directional Boundary Crossings

Not just "crossed" or "not crossed" — **which direction** the dependency flows:

| Direction | Meaning | Verdict |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| UPWARD | child → parent | OK |
| COMMON | anything → _00 package | OK |
| SIBLING | module → module | BAD — extract to common |
| DOWNWARD | parent → child | BAD — inverts hierarchy |
| EXTERNAL | cross-hierarchy | WARN — isolation violation |
| CIRCULAR | A→B + B→A siblings | BAD — coupled modules |

Export to 7 formats: `text`, `json`, `md`, `mermaid`, `html`, `dot` (Graphviz), `plantuml`, `graphml` (Gephi/yEd).

### Side Effect & LUW Analysis

The parser detects transactional patterns in ABAP source:

| What | Detected |
|------|----------|
| DB read/write | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MODIFY |
| LUW ownership | COMMIT WORK, ROLLBACK WORK |
| Deferred execution | IN UPDATE TASK, IN BACKGROUND TASK |
| Async | STARTING NEW TASK (aRFC), SUBMIT VIA JOB |
| External calls | RFC DESTINATION, HTTP client, APC/WebSocket |
| Transactions | CALL TRANSACTION, LEAVE TO TRANSACTION |
| Transformations | CALL TRANSFORMATION |

LUW classification: **safe** / **participant** / **owner** / **unsafe**.

### Health Reports

Full health reports with test details, ATC findings, and boundary crossings:

```bash
vsp health --package '$ZDEV' --details          # text with all details
vsp health --package '$ZDEV' --report md        # → _ZDEV.md
vsp health --package '$ZDEV' --report html      # → _ZDEV.html
vsp health --package '$ZDEV' --report my.html   # → my.html
```

Tests discover embedded local test classes across the full package hierarchy — the same as Eclipse Ctrl+Shift+F10.

### Hyperfocused Mode — 1 Tool to Rule Them All (Recommended)

**Recommended for most setups.** Single `SAP(action, target, params)` tool replaces up to 147 individual tool definitions. Minimal token overhead, maximum capability.

```
SAP(action="read",   target="CLAS ZCL_TRAVEL")
SAP(action="edit",   target="CLAS ZCL_TRAVEL", params={"source": "..."})
SAP(action="create", target="DEVC", params={"name": "$ZOZIK", "description": "New pkg"})
SAP(action="help",   target="debug")
```

| Metric | Focused (100 tools) | Expert (147 tools) | Hyperfocused (1 tool) |
|--------|-------------------:|-------------------:|----------------------:|
| MCP schema tokens | ~14,000 | ~40,000 | **~200** |
| Reduction | — | — | **99.5%** |

All safety controls (`--read-only`, `--allowed-ops`, `--allowed-packages`) work identically — the universal tool routes through the same handler → ADT client → `checkSafety()` chain.

> *Thanks to [Filipp Gnilyak](https://github.com/nickel-f) for the hyperfocused mode concept.*

### Context Compression — Built-in ABAP Understanding

`GetSource` auto-appends a **compressed dependency prologue** — public API signatures of every referenced class, interface, and FM. One MCP call = source + full surrounding context.

**How it works:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["GetSource<br/>ZCL_TRAVEL"] --> B["10 regex patterns<br/>scan source"]
    B --> C["TYPE REF TO<br/>NEW · => · ~<br/>INHERITING FROM<br/>INTERFACES<br/>CALL FUNCTION<br/>CAST · RAISING"]
    C --> D["Fetch deps<br/>5 parallel"]
    D --> E["Extract contract<br/>PUBLIC SECTION only"]
    E --> F["Source +<br/>Compressed Prologue"]
```

**Compression by object type:**

| What | Keeps | Strips | Typical ratio |
|------|-------|--------|:-------------:|
| **Class** | `CLASS DEFINITION` + `PUBLIC SECTION` | Protected, Private, Implementation | **7–30x** |
| **Interface** | Full `INTERFACE...ENDINTERFACE` | — | 1x (already compact) |
| **Function Module** | `FUNCTION` line + `*"` signature block | Body | **5–15x** |

**Real-world example** — `ZCL_ABAPGIT_ADT_LINK` (abapGit codebase):
- 8 dependencies detected → 8 resolved, 0 failed
- Dependencies include: `ZIF_ABAPGIT_DEFINITIONS` (massive interface), `ZCX_ABAPGIT_EXCEPTION`, `CL_WB_OBJECT` (14 methods), `IF_ADT_URI_MAPPER` (8 methods), etc.
- All compressed to **public signatures only** — no implementation bodies, no private sections

### Method-Level Surgery — Read and Edit Individual Methods

Why pull an entire 1000-line class when you only need one 30-line method?

```
# Read just the FACTORIAL method — not the whole class
SAP(action="read", target="CLAS ZCL_CALCULATOR", params={"method": "FACTORIAL"})

# Edit just that method — vsp handles the rest
SAP(action="edit", target="CLAS ZCL_CALCULATOR", params={
  "method": "FACTORIAL",
  "source": "  METHOD factorial.\n    ...\n  ENDMETHOD."
})
```

**What happens under the hood on edit:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant LLM as AI Agent
    participant VSP as vsp
    participant SAP as SAP System

    LLM->>VSP: SAP(edit, CLAS ZCL_FOO, method=BAR, source=...)
    VSP->>SAP: GetClassMethods() → find BAR boundaries
    VSP->>SAP: GetClassSource() → full class
    Note over VSP: Replace lines 42-58<br/>with new METHOD block
    VSP->>SAP: SyntaxCheck(full reconstructed source)
    VSP->>SAP: Lock → UpdateSource → Unlock → Activate
    VSP->>LLM: ✓ Method BAR updated, class activated
```

The AI only sends/receives the method block (~30 lines). vsp fetches the full class internally, splices in the new method at the right line range, validates, and pushes back. **95% token reduction** vs full-class round-trips.

**Context compression scopes to the method too** — when reading a single method, dependency analysis runs on _that method's code only_, so the prologue contains exactly the types and interfaces relevant to the method you're working on, not the entire class's dependency tree.

| Operation | Tokens (full class) | Tokens (method-level) | Savings |
|-----------|:-------------------:|:---------------------:|:-------:|
| Read source | ~1,000 | ~50 | **20x** |
| Read + context | ~1,600 | ~250 | **6x** |
| Edit round-trip | ~2,000 | ~100 | **20x** |

> *Built-in ABAP parser based on [abaplint](https://github.com/abaplint/abaplint) by [Lars Hvam](https://github.com/larshp) — the same parser that powers abaplint's 392 ABAP statement types.*

### Native Go ABAP Lexer — abaplint in Go

The [abaplint](https://github.com/abaplint/abaplint) lexer has been mechanically ported from TypeScript to native Go (`pkg/abaplint`). This is the same lexer that powers abaplint — 48 token types, all 6 lexer modes (normal, string, backtick, template, comment, pragma), with full whitespace-context encoding.

**Verified via oracle-based differential testing** against the real TypeScript abaplint:

```
=== DIFFERENTIAL KPI ===
Files:   29/29 passed (100.0%)
Tokens:  22,612 total
  Full match:  22,612 (100.0%)  — str + type + row + col
  Str match:   22,612 (100.0%)
  Type match:  22,612 (100.0%)
  Pos match:   22,612 (100.0%)
```

Zero dependencies, zero FFI. Pure Go, ~3.5M tokens/sec, ready for lint rules in Phase 2.

### ABAP LSP — Real-Time Diagnostics

`vsp lsp --stdio` gives Claude Code (and other editors) **automatic** error detection and navigation for ABAP files. No explicit tool calls — the LSP pushes diagnostics on every save and compressed dependency context on file open.

See [LSP setup](#abap-lsp-for-claude-code) for configuration.

### WASM-to-ABAP Compiler (Research)

Compile WebAssembly binaries to native ABAP — advanced prototype, verified on selected corpora. Three paths:

```
.wasm binary → pkg/wasmcomp (Go)  → ABAP source files     ← AOT compiler
.ts source   → pkg/ts2abap (Go)   → clean OO ABAP classes  ← direct transpiler
.wasm binary → zcl_wasm_compiler  → ABAP (on SAP itself!)  ← self-hosting, 785 lines
```

**Demonstrated on SAP A4H:** QuickJS (1,410 functions) compiled to 101K lines ABAP. abaplint parser (26.5MB) compiled to 396K lines. Self-hosting compiler parses WASM, generates ABAP, and executes via `GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL` — all within SAP. This is research/prototype work, not a production-ready toolchain.

| What | Size | Status |
|------|:----:|:------:|
| QuickJS → ABAP | 101K lines | Compiled |
| abaplint → ABAP | 396K lines | Compiled |
| abaplint lexer (TS→ABAP) | 495 lines | Running on SAP |
| Self-hosting compiler | 785 lines | Running on SAP |
| Batch deploy | `vsp deploy *.clas.abap` | 40 classes, 0 failures |

> *Branch: `feat/wasm-abap`. See [reports/2026-03-20-001](reports/2026-03-20-001-wasm-abap-achievement.md) for full details.*

### Full CLI Toolchain — SAP from the Terminal

35+ commands. No SAP GUI, no Eclipse, no IDE. Most work with standard ADT; `lint`/`parse`/`compile` work fully offline.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Download from releases
curl -LO https://github.com/vinchacho/vibing-steampunk/releases/latest/download/vsp-linux-amd64
chmod +x vsp-linux-amd64

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/vinchacho/vibing-steampunk.git && cd vibing-steampunk
make build
```
### Windows 11 with VS Code + Claude Code extension:
#### 1. Get the latest vsp release:
https://github.com/oisee/vibing-steampunk/releases.

If you have trouble downloading executable files in your browser, use `curl -o url` or `wget` to download the file. Name the file `vsp.exe`.

Put the file in a local folder and open the folder in VS Code.

Add the vsp folder to your `PATH` environment variable for your user. Either through command line or Windows Registry Editor `regedit`. Add the vsp folder to `KEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment\Path`.

Restart your VS Code to recognize the updated `PATH` before progressing to the next steps.

#### 2. Initialize the config files:
Open a terminal in VS Code, then run `./vsp config init` to create config template files:
-	`.env.example`
-	`.vsp.json.example`
-	`.mcp.json.example`

#### 3. Adjust your config files:
 Make sure you delete the comment lines. Refer to the example files in this `README`.

#### 4. Set up authentication

**For basic auth:** Set up a password for your user to allow for basic authentication. Go to `SU01 > Logon Data`, generate an initial password. Then log in again (without SNC/SSO in SAPGUI) and change the initial password. You are now set up for basic authentication via config file in vsp. Set your environment variables `SAP_USER` and `SAP_PASSWORD` accordingly.

You now need to obtain the SAP hostname for your `SAP_URL` environment variable: Log in to any web-based application (e.g. Fiori Launchpad) and obtain the URL from your browser. Attention: `SAP_URL` is not **not** your message/group server from SAP Logon!

**Alternatively use cookie authentication:**
If you cannot set a password for your user, you may still use cookie authentication to access your SAP system from vsp. 

Extract cookies manually and save them in `cookies.txt` in your vsp folder. Use cookies `SAP_SESSIONID_SYS_CLI` and `sap-usercontext` on your previously determined URL (caution: use `https://` prefix for secure connections). Refer to below guide on how to manually extract cookies from your browser.

**Template cookie file:**
```
# Netscape HTTP Cookie File
# https://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html

https://your.domain.com	FALSE	/	TRUE	0	SAP_SESSIONID_SYS_CLI  YOUR_CONTENT
https://your.domain.com	FALSE	/	TRUE	0	sap-usercontext        YOUR_CONTENT
```
Replace the hostname, `SYS` with your system ID (e.g. DS1) and `CLI` with your client number (e.g. 100).

**For BTP/Cloud based systems**: Use cookies `__VCAP_ID__` and `JSESSIONID` on your domain `https://xyz.ondemand.com`. This also works for BTP trial accounts. Also refer to <a href="https://medium.com/@warren_eiserman/vibe-steam-punk-vsp-for-abap-cloud-mac-claude-2864d601978f">this article</a>.

**Obtaining cookies from your browser session:**

The easiest way to do so is to use Edge as it allows you to display cookie contents from its settings page. From there you can copy & paste them into the newly created `cookies.txt` file.

Open any transaction in WebDynpro or Fiori Launchpad. For older environments like ECC it should work with BRF+ transactions that open in a browser. Login with your credentials. Once logged in it’s a matter of extracting the created session cookies.

In Edge, go to `Settings > Privacy, search and services > Cookies > See all cookies and site data`. Search for your top-level domain. There should be two cookies for your system as described above (`SAP_SESSIONID` and `sap-usercontext` or `VCAP_ID` and `JSESSIONID` if your system is cloud-based). Copy the content values for each cookie to your local file and save.

The created cookies are session cookies. They will eventually expire after a timeout and the values in cookies.txt need to be updated. Usually Claude will tell you if this is the case.

#### 5. Test the connection: 
Use the terminal with this command: `./vsp -s dev search "zcl_*" --type CLAS --max 50`.

You will get prompted with a list of found objects if the connection could be established. 


## CLI Coding Agents

VSP works with **8 CLI coding agents** — not just Claude! Full setup guides with config templates:

| Agent | Model Access | Availability | Config |
|-------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| **Gemini CLI** | Gemini models | Free tier available; paid/API-backed usage also available | `.gemini/settings.json` |
| **Claude Code** | Claude models | Paid usage or subscription-backed access | `.mcp.json` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Multi-model (plan-dependent) | Free tier available; paid plans unlock more limits/models | `.copilot/mcp-config.json` |
| **OpenAI Codex** | OpenAI coding models / ChatGPT-linked access | Limited or plan-dependent access; API usage also available | `codex.toml` |
| **Qwen Code** | Qwen models | Free tier available; BYOK/API-backed usage also available | `.qwen/settings.json` |
| **OpenCode** | Multi-provider BYOK | Depends on your provider/account | `opencode.json` |
| **Goose** | Multi-provider BYOK | Depends on your provider/account | `~/.config/goose/config.yaml` |
| **Mistral Vibe** | Mistral API or local models | Local/Ollama path can be free; API usage is provider-billed | `.vibe/config.toml` |

Availability, pricing, and model lineups change quickly. Check the linked agent guides and official product docs before copying limits or plan claims into downstream docs.

For the new graph analysis capabilities, see **[Graph Guide](docs/graph-guide.md)**.

## CLI Mode

vsp works in two modes:
1. **MCP Server Mode** (default) - Exposes tools via Model Context Protocol for Claude
2. **CLI Mode** - Direct command-line operations without MCP

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Source operations
vsp -s a4h source CLAS ZCL_MY_CLASS              # read source
vsp -s a4h source read CLAS ZCL_MY_CLASS          # same, explicit
vsp -s a4h source write CLAS ZCL_FOO < file.abap  # write from stdin
vsp -s a4h source edit CLAS ZCL_FOO --old "X" --new "Y"  # surgical edit
vsp -s a4h source context CLAS ZCL_FOO            # source + dependency contracts

# Transport management
vsp -s a4h transport list                         # list transports
vsp -s a4h transport get A4HK900094               # transport details

# System management
vsp systems                                       # list configured systems
vsp config init                                   # create example configs

# Start ABAP LSP server (for Claude Code / editors)
vsp lsp --stdio
```

Graph-MVP highlights:

- `vsp graph co-change <type> <name>` for transport-based co-change analysis
- `vsp graph where-used-config <variable>` for heuristic TVARVC usage analysis
- `SAP(action="analyze", params={"type":"co_change", ...})` for MCP co-change
- `SAP(action="analyze", params={"type":"impact", ...})` for reverse dependency impact
- `SAP(action="analyze", params={"type":"where_used_config", ...})` for MCP TVARVC usage

### System Profiles (`.vsp.json`)

Configure multiple SAP systems in `.vsp.json`:

```json
{
  "default": "dev",
  "systems": {
    "dev": {
      "url": "http://dev.example.com:50000",
      "user": "DEVELOPER",

## Usage with Claude

### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "abap-adt": {
      "command": "/path/to/vsp",
      "env": {
        "SAP_URL": "https://your-sap-host:44300",
        "SAP_USER": "your-username",
        "SAP_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

Add `.mcp.json` to your project:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "abap-adt": {
      "command": "/path/to/vsp",
      "env": {
        "SAP_URL": "https://your-sap-host:44300",
        "SAP_USER": "your-username",
        "SAP_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### ABAP LSP for Claude Code

vsp includes a built-in LSP server that gives Claude Code **automatic** error detection when editing ABAP files — no explicit tool calls needed.

**Add to Claude Code settings** (`.claude/settings.json` or global settings):

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "abap": {
      "command": "vsp",
      "args": ["lsp", "--stdio"],
      "extensionToLanguage": {
        ".abap": "abap",
        ".asddls": "abap",
        ".asbdef": "abap"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

SAP credentials are resolved from environment variables or `.env` file — same as MCP mode.

**Supported LSP features:**

| Feature | Method | Source |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Real-time syntax errors | `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` | ADT SyntaxCheck |
| Go-to-definition | `textDocument/definition` | ADT FindDefinition |

**Supported file patterns** (abapGit naming convention):

| Extension | Object Type |
|-----------|-------------|
| `.clas.abap` | Class (main source) |
| `.clas.testclasses.abap` | Class test includes |
| `.clas.locals_def.abap` | Class local definitions |
| `.prog.abap` | Program / Report |
| `.intf.abap` | Interface |
| `.fugr.abap` | Function Group |
| `.ddls.asddls` | CDS View |

Namespace convention (`#dmo#cl_flight.clas.abap` → `/DMO/CL_FLIGHT`) is handled automatically.

### Transportable Packages Configuration

To work with transportable packages (non-`$` prefixed), you **must** explicitly enable transport support:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "abap-adt": {
      "command": "/path/to/vsp",
      "env": {
        "SAP_URL": "https://your-sap-host:44300",
        "SAP_USER": "your-username",
        "SAP_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "SAP_CLIENT": "001",
        "SAP_ALLOW_TRANSPORTABLE_EDITS": "true",
        "SAP_ALLOWED_TRANSPORTS": "DEVK*,A4HK*",
        "SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES": "ZPROD,$TMP,$*,Z*"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Env Variable | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `SAP_ALLOW_TRANSPORTABLE_EDITS` | Enable editing objects in transportable packages |
| `SAP_ENABLE_TRANSPORTS` | Enable full transport management (create, release) |
| `SAP_ALLOWED_TRANSPORTS` | Whitelist transport patterns (wildcards supported) |
| `SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES` | Whitelist package patterns (wildcards supported) |

**CreatePackage with software component:**
```
CreatePackage(
  name="ZPROD_005",
  description="Sub-package",
  parent="ZPROD",
  transport="DEVK900123",
  software_component="HOME"
)
```

Without these flags, operations on transportable packages will be blocked by the safety system.

## Tool Modes

One axis, three values — `--mode` or `SAP_MODE`:

```mermaid
graph LR
    F["focused<br/>100 tools<br/>~14K tokens"] --> E["expert<br/>147 tools<br/>~40K tokens"]
    E --> H["hyperfocused<br/>1 tool<br/>~200 tokens<br/><i>recommended</i>"]
    style H fill:#2d6a4f,color:#fff,stroke:#4ade80,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#264653,color:#fff
    style E fill:#264653,color:#fff
```

| Aspect | Focused | Expert | Hyperfocused (recommended) |
|--------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Tools** | 100 essential | 147 complete | 1 universal `SAP()` |
| **Schema tokens** | ~14K | ~40K | **~200** |
| **How AI calls it** | `GetSource(type, name)` | Same, + granular tools | `SAP(action, target, params)` |
| **Documentation** | In tool schemas | In tool schemas | `SAP(action="help")` |
| **Best for** | Legacy setups | Edge cases, debugging | **Most setups — any model, minimal overhead** |
| **Safety controls** | All apply | All apply | All apply (same code path) |

```bash
vsp --mode hyperfocused  # recommended — single SAP(action, target, params) tool
vsp --mode focused       # 100 curated tools (individual tool names)
vsp --mode expert        # all 147 tools individually
```

## DSL & Automation

### YAML Workflows

```yaml
# ci-pipeline.yaml
name: CI Pipeline
vars:
  package: "$TMP"
steps:
  - action: search
    query: "ZCL_*"
    types: [class]
    package: "{{ .package }}"
    save_as: classes

  - action: test
    objects: "{{ .classes }}"
    parallel: 4

  - action: fail_if
    condition: tests_failed
    message: "Unit tests failed"
```

```bash
vsp workflow run ci-pipeline.yaml --var package='$ZRAY'
```

### Go Library

```go
// Fluent search
objects, _ := dsl.Search(client).
    Query("ZCL_*").Classes().InPackage("$TMP").Execute(ctx)

// Test orchestration
summary, _ := dsl.Test(client).
    Objects(objects...).Parallel(4).Run(ctx)

// Batch import from directory (abapGit-compatible)
result, _ := dsl.Import(client).
    FromDirectory("./src/").
    ToPackage("$ZRAY").
    RAPOrder().  // DDLS → BDEF → Classes → SRVD
    Execute(ctx)

// Export classes with all includes
result, _ := dsl.Export(client).
    Classes("ZCL_TRAVEL", "ZCL_BOOKING").
    ToDirectory("./backup/").
    Execute(ctx)

// RAP deployment pipeline
pipeline := dsl.RAPPipeline(client, "./src/", "$ZRAY", "ZTRAVEL_SB")
```

See [docs/DSL.md](docs/DSL.md) for complete documentation.

## RAP OData Service Creation

VSP supports full RAP OData E2E development since v2.6.0. Create complete OData services via AI assistant:

### Step-by-Step Workflow

**1. Create CDS View (DDLS)**
```
WriteSource(
  object_type="DDLS",
  name="ZTRAVEL",
  package="$TMP",
  description="Travel Entity",
  source=`
@EndUserText.label: 'Travel'
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
define root view entity ZTRAVEL as select from ztravel_tab {
  key travel_id as TravelId,
  description as Description,
  start_date as StartDate,
  end_date as EndDate,
  status as Status
}
`
)
```

**2. Create Behavior Definition (BDEF)**
```
WriteSource(
  object_type="BDEF",
  name="ZTRAVEL",
  package="$TMP",
  description="Travel Behavior",
  source=`
managed implementation in class ZBP_TRAVEL unique;
strict ( 2 );

define behavior for ZTRAVEL alias Travel
persistent table ztravel_tab
lock master
authorization master ( instance )
{
  field ( readonly ) TravelId;
  field ( mandatory ) Description;

  create;
  update;
  delete;

  mapping for ztravel_tab {
    TravelId = travel_id;
    Description = description;
    StartDate = start_date;
    EndDate = end_date;
    Status = status;
  }
}
`
)
```

**3. Create Service Definition (SRVD)**
```
WriteSource(
  object_type="SRVD",
  name="ZTRAVEL_SD",
  package="$TMP",
  description="Travel Service Definition",
  source=`
@EndUserText.label: 'Travel Service'
define service ZTRAVEL_SD {
  expose ZTRAVEL;
}
`
)
```

**4. Create Service Binding (SRVB)**
```
WriteSource(
  object_type="SRVB",
  name="ZTRAVEL_SB",
  package="$TMP",
  description="Travel OData V4 Binding",
  service_definition="ZTRAVEL_SD",
  binding_version="V4"
)
```

### Binding Options

| Parameter | Values | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `binding_version` | `V2`, `V4` | OData protocol version |
| `binding_category` | `0`, `1` | `0`=Web API, `1`=UI |

### For Transportable Packages

Add `transport` parameter to all WriteSource calls:
```
WriteSource(
  object_type="DDLS",
  name="ZTRAVEL",
  package="ZPROD",
  transport="DEVK900123",
  ...
)
```

- DSL Pipeline: `dsl.RAPPipeline(client, "./src/", "$PKG", "ZSRV_SB")`

## ExecuteABAP

Run arbitrary ABAP code via unit test wrapper:

```
ExecuteABAP:
  code: |
    DATA(lv_msg) = |Hello from SAP at { sy-datum }|.
    lv_result = lv_msg.
```

**Risk levels:** `harmless` (read-only), `dangerous` (write), `critical` (full access)

See [ExecuteABAP Report](reports/2025-12-05-004-execute-abap-implementation.md) for details.

## AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis

vsp enables AI assistants to investigate production issues autonomously:

```
User: "Investigate the ZERODIVIDE crash in production"

AI Workflow:
  1. GetDumps      → Find recent crashes by exception type
  2. GetDump       → Analyze stack trace and variable values
  3. GetSource     → Read code at crash location
  4. GetCallGraph  → Trace call hierarchy
  5. GrepPackages  → Find similar patterns
  6. Analysis      → Identify root cause
  7. Propose Fix   → Generate solution + test case
```

**Example Output:**
> "The crash occurs in `ZCL_PRICING=>CALCULATE_RATIO` when `LV_TOTAL=0`.
> This happens for archived orders with no line items. Here's the fix..."

See [AI-Powered RCA Workflows](reports/2025-12-05-013-ai-powered-rca-workflows.md) for the complete vision.

**vsp** is a Go rewrite with:
- Single binary, zero dependencies
- 147 tools (vs 13 original)
- ~50x faster startup

## Optional: WebSocket Handler (ZADT_VSP)

vsp can optionally deploy a WebSocket handler to SAP for enhanced functionality like RFC calls:

```bash
# 1. Create package
vsp CreatePackage --name '$ZADT_VSP' --description 'VSP WebSocket Handler'

# 2. Deploy objects (embedded in binary)
vsp WriteSource --object_type INTF --name ZIF_VSP_SERVICE --package '$ZADT_VSP' \
    --source "$(cat embedded/abap/zif_vsp_service.intf.abap)"
vsp WriteSource --object_type CLAS --name ZCL_VSP_RFC_SERVICE --package '$ZADT_VSP' \
    --source "$(cat embedded/abap/zcl_vsp_rfc_service.clas.abap)"
vsp WriteSource --object_type CLAS --name ZCL_VSP_APC_HANDLER --package '$ZADT_VSP' \
    --source "$(cat embedded/abap/zcl_vsp_apc_handler.clas.abap)"

# 3. Manually create APC app in SAPC + activate in SICF
#    See embedded/abap/README.md for details
```

**After deployment**, connect via WebSocket to call RFCs:
```json
{"id":"1","domain":"rfc","action":"call","params":{"function":"BAPI_USER_GET_DETAIL","USERNAME":"TESTUSER"}}
```

See [WebSocket Handler Report](reports/2025-12-18-002-websocket-rfc-handler.md) for complete documentation.

## Lua Scripting (New in v2.14)

Automate debugging workflows with Lua scripts:

```bash
# Interactive REPL
vsp lua

# Run a script
vsp lua examples/scripts/debug-session.lua

# Execute inline
vsp lua -e 'print(json.encode(searchObject("ZCL_*", 10)))'
```

**Example: Set breakpoint and debug**
```lua
-- Set breakpoint
local bpId = setBreakpoint("ZTEST_PROGRAM", 42)
print("Breakpoint: " .. bpId)

-- Wait for debuggee
local event = listen(60)
if event then
    attach(event.id)
    print("Stack:")
    for i, frame in ipairs(getStack()) do
        print("  " .. frame.program .. ":" .. frame.line)
    end
    stepOver()
    detach()
end
```

**Available Functions:**
- **Search**: `searchObject`, `grepObjects`
- **Source**: `getSource`, `writeSource`, `editSource`
- **Debug**: `setBreakpoint`, `listen`, `attach`, `detach`, `stepOver`, `stepInto`, `stepReturn`, `continue_`, `getStack`, `getVariables`
- **Checkpoints**: `saveCheckpoint`, `getCheckpoint`, `listCheckpoints`, `injectCheckpoint`
- **Diagnostics**: `getDumps`, `getDump`, `runUnitTests`, `syntaxCheck`
- **Call Graph**: `getCallGraph`, `getCallersOf`, `getCalleesOf`
- **Utilities**: `print`, `sleep`, `json.encode`, `json.decode`

See `examples/scripts/` for more examples.

### Example: Capture FM Execution for Test Generation

```lua
-- Step 1: Set breakpoint on function module entry
local bpId = setBreakpoint("SAPL<FGROUP>", 10)  -- Entry point

-- Step 2: Prepare to capture multiple executions
local captures = {}

-- Step 3: Loop to capture test cases
for i = 1, 10 do
    local event = listen(120)  -- Wait for debuggee
    if not event then break end

    attach(event.id)

    -- Capture input parameters at entry
    local vars = getVariables()
    local testCase = {
        id = i,
        inputs = extractInputs(vars),  -- IV_*, IT_*, IS_*
        timestamp = os.time()
    }

    -- Step to end to capture outputs
    continue_()
    local event2 = listen(5)
    if event2 then
        attach(event2.id)
        testCase.outputs = extractOutputs(getVariables())  -- EV_*, ET_*, ES_*, RETURN
    end

    -- Save checkpoint for replay
    saveCheckpoint("testcase_" .. i, testCase)
    table.insert(captures, testCase)

    detach()
end

-- Step 4: Export for AI processing
print(json.encode(captures))
```

### AI Processing Pipeline

After capturing test cases, AI can:

1. **Normalize & Deduplicate** - Group similar inputs, identify unique scenarios
2. **Explain Patterns** - "TestCase 3 tests error path when IV_AMOUNT < 0"
3. **Generate Unit Tests** - Create ABAP Unit test class with proper mocks

```
User: "Analyze captured test cases and generate unit tests"

AI Workflow:
  1. Load checkpoints     → listCheckpoints("testcase_*")
  2. Analyze patterns     → Cluster by input signatures
  3. Identify edge cases  → Empty tables, zero values, error conditions
  4. Generate mock specs  → Which FMs/DB tables need mocking
  5. Create ABAP Unit     → ZCL_TEST_<FM> with test methods
  6. Deploy tests         → WriteSource to SAP system
```
