## Overview

This roadmap outlines the path to transform vsp from a standalone CLI tool into the execution foundation for autonomous SAP development at enterprise scale.

**Goal**: Enable "Phase 1.5" - AI agents that execute autonomously while humans review and approve.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (0-3 months)

### Objective
Establish vsp as a viable execution layer with enterprise-specific context and safety validation.

### Deliverables

#### 1.1 CBA MCP Integration (SKILLS Pattern)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks

- [ ] **CBA ABAP Documentation MCP Server Integration**
  - Connect to existing CBA MCP server
  - Implement SKILLS pattern (just-in-time retrieval)
  - **3 CBA SKILLS implementation**:
    - `QueryCBAGuidelines`: Coding standards, architectural guardrails on-demand
    - `ValidateAgainstCBAStandards`: Real-time validation against CBA standards
    - `LearnFromCBAIncidents`: Historical production incidents, anti-patterns
  - MCP connection pool with caching and rate limiting
  - SKILLS registry for extensibility

- [ ] **Code Example Retrieval via vsp Native Tools**
  - Use existing vsp tools (already connected via ADT REST APIs):
    - `GrepObjects` - Find code patterns across packages
    - `GetSource` - Retrieve source code for any object
    - `GetObjectStructure` - Understand object design
    - `ListDependencies` - Analyze object relationships
    - `GetCallGraph` - Trace execution paths
  - **No separate DB3 MCP needed** - vsp already provides full object access
  - Eliminates redundancy and maintenance overhead

**Success Criteria**:
- AI agents can query CBA-specific context on-demand
- 99.2% token reduction achieved (1.6k vs 200k)

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a pragmatic path from vsp as a CLI tool to vsp as the execution foundation for enterprise autonomous SAP development.

**Key differentiators**:
- **Operational today**: No waiting for future SAP releases
- **Incremental value**: Each phase delivers standalone value
- **Risk-managed**: Safety and governance built-in from day one
- **Complements existing vision**: Bridges Phase 1 → Phase 2

**Strategic positioning**: vsp is not replacing SAP Joule or other tools - it's the **execution layer** they need to achieve true autonomy.
