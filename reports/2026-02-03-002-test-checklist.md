**Status:** [ ] Not tested

---

### Test 8: Verbose Output Check
**Command:**
```bash
./vsp --allow-transportable-edits --verbose

**Expected:** Should show:
```
[VERBOSE] Safety: Transportable edits ENABLED (can modify non-local objects)
```
**Status:** [ ] Not tested

---

### Test 9: Environment Variable
**Command:**
```bash
SAP_ALLOW_TRANSPORTABLE_EDITS=true ./vsp --verbose
```
**Expected:** Same as Test 8
**Status:** [ ] Not tested

---

### Test 10: Package Restriction + Transportable Edits
**Command:**
```bash
./vsp --allow-transportable-edits --allowed-packages "ZPROD"
```
**Action:** Try to edit object in different package
**Expected:** ERROR - package not allowed
**Status:** [ ] Not tested

---

## Tool Visibility Tests (IMPLEMENTED)

### Test 11: ListTransports Blocked by Default
**Command:**
```bash
./vsp
```
**Action:** Call ListTransports
**Expected:** ERROR - "transports not enabled"
**Status:** [ ] Not tested

### Test 12: ListTransports Works with --allow-transportable-edits
**Command:**
```bash
./vsp --allow-transportable-edits
```

**Status:** [ ] Not tested

---

### Test 13: GetTransport Works with --allow-transportable-edits
**Command:**
```bash
./vsp --allow-transportable-edits
```
**Action:** Call GetTransport with transport="A4HK900114"
**Expected:** SUCCESS - shows transport details
**Status:** [ ] Not tested

---

### Test 14: CreateTransport Still Requires --enable-transports
**Command:**
```bash
./vsp --allow-transportable-edits
```
**Action:** Call CreateTransport
**Expected:** ERROR - "requires --enable-transports flag"
**Status:** [ ] Not tested

---

## Post-Test Cleanup

### Objects to Review
- [ ] ZPROD_001_TEST - may have test edits
- [ ] ZPROD_002_TEST - created during testing
- [ ] ZPROD_003_TEST - may be created in Test 7
- [ ] ZCL_PROD_TEST - created during testing

### Transport Status

## Test Session: 2026-02-03

### Tested via MCP (SAP_ALLOW_TRANSPORTABLE_EDITS=true, SAP_ALLOWED_TRANSPORTS=A4HK*)

**Test 3 & 5: EditSource with transport + whitelist**
```
EditSource on ZPROD_001_TEST with transport A4HK900114
Result: SUCCESS - edit applied, object activated
Added: "* Safety feature test - 2026-02-03"
```

**Test 7: WriteSource with transport**
```
WriteSource ZPROD_003_TEST with transport A4HK900114
Result: SUCCESS - program created and activated
```

**Test 9: Environment variable**
```
.mcp.json configured with SAP_ALLOW_TRANSPORTABLE_EDITS=true
Config was applied successfully - edits allowed
```

### CLI Tests (bypassing MCP, direct vsp invocation)

**Test 2: EditSource with transport, flag OFF → BLOCKED ✅**
```
"EditSource failed: operation 'EditSource' with transport 'A4HK900114' is blocked:
editing transportable objects is disabled..."
```

**Test 4: EditSource with wrong whitelist (DEVK*) → BLOCKED ✅**
```
"EditSource failed: operation 'EditSource' with transport 'A4HK900114' is blocked
by safety configuration (allowed transports: [DEVK*])"
```

**Test 6: WriteSource with transport, flag OFF → BLOCKED ✅**
```
"WriteSource failed: operation 'WriteSource' with transport 'A4HK900114' is blocked:
editing transportable objects is disabled..."
```

### Objects Created
- ZPROD_003_TEST - New program created via WriteSource

---

## Notes

- Tool visibility implemented: ListTransports/GetTransport work with --enable-transports OR --allow-transportable-edits
- .vsp.json updated to enable GetTransport, GetUserTransports, ListTransports
- MCP restart required for .vsp.json changes to take effect
