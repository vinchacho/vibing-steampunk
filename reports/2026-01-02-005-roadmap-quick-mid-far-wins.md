## Recommended Priorities

### Immediate (Next Sprint)
1. **`/debug` skill** - Biggest bang for buck, uses existing tools
2. **RunReport via FM** - Unblocks report execution with ALV capture
3. **GetMessages** - Completes the "report authoring" story

### This Month
- **ATC integration** - Code quality is always high value
- **Basic DAP adapter** - Opens VS Code market
- **Transport workflow** - Enterprise customers need this

### This Quarter
- **Graph traversal** - Architectural analysis, impact assessment
- **Test intelligence** - Smart CI/CD integration
