description: Show VSP system info, available features, and dependencies
---

Display a comprehensive status report of the connected SAP system.

## Workflow

1. Run **GetSystemInfo** — show system ID, release, kernel version, database
2. Run **GetFeatures** — show which features are available:
   - HANA, abapGit, RAP, AMDP, UI5, Transport
   - For each: Available (yes/no), Mode (auto/on/off)
3. Run **ListDependencies** — show ZADT_VSP installation status
4. Report the current VSP mode (`focused` / `expert` / `hyperfocused`) and any safety restrictions
5. Report the auth method in use (basic / cookie / browser SSO)
